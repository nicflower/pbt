This is a dummy app to follow along the reading of "Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir"  by Fred Herbert.

To run property tests:
```
mix test
```

This reading heavily relies on the `propcheck` library, [here](https://hexdocs.pm/propcheck/readme.html) can be found its documentation.
